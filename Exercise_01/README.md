# Exercise
In this exercise we have to create a GAN that generates images of melanoma similar
to [isic-archive](https://isic-archive.com).

This repository contains the following tools
* **[isic_dataset](#isic_dataset)** a tool to download, resize and augment images from the isic-archive
* **[GANcontrol](#GANcontrol)** used to train GAN's, generate images with pre trained models, and continue training models
* **[DCGAN](#DCGAN)** a deep convolutional GAN based on [YadiraF's dcgan](https://github.com/YadiraF/GAN/blob/master/dcgan.py)
* **[img2dist](#img2dist)** a tool to calculate image similarity based on [Color Quantization](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_color_quantization.html) and can visualize the distribution of multiple images by generating scatter plots of  

# GANcontrol
Gancontrol is helper script that facilitates the training, retraining and generation of images.

## Training
Train a model on images in ./training_data for 200000 training cycles with a batch size of 16, storing results to ./trained_model_output

    python GANcontrol.py training ./training_data 200000 16 ./trained_model_output

> Note: Use the option --keep-checkpoints to keep intermediate trained models

## Image generation
Use a pre trained network in **newgen/ckpt-10000/dcgan.ckpt** and generate 50 new images, storing them in **./newlycreated**.

```bash
python GANcontrol.py generate newgen/ckpt-10000/dcgan.ckpt 50 ./newlycreated
```

> Note: use the option --overview to generate a single figure containing NxN pictures

# DCGAN
This is a deep convolution GAN based on [YadiraF's dcgan](https://github.com/YadiraF/GAN/blob/master/dcgan.py). It has been altered 
to be trained and generate images of 160x160 pixels.

The best results have been obtained by hand selecting 55 images from the isis-archive and using image augmentation to generate 10000 training images.
The hand [selected image subset](training_images_160x160_subset) and the augmented [training set](training_set/training_images_160x160_augmented_10k.tar.bz2), are part of this repository. 

The network was trained on an Tesla P100-PCIE-12GB GPU for about 17 hours, producing results similar to

# isic_dataset
This tool canb e used to download imges, preprocess them, and augment them using [Augmentor](https://github.com/mdbloice/Augmentor).

    python isic_dataset.py --help


## Download Images
One can download multiple images from the different data sets offered by isic

    python isic_dataset.py download --help

Example Download 1000 images to the folder original_images

    python isic_dataset.py download ./original_images -n 1000

*Note* Based on the content of the isic-archive fewer pictures might be downloaded
than specified.

## Transform Images
The original images exist in different resolutions and sizes. In order to use them
for training they have to be reshaped to the same size. This is done by center
cropping and resizing.

    python isic_dataset.py transform --help

Example: Transform all images in ./original_images to a size of 100x100 and store them in the folder ./test_images

    python isic_dataset.py transform ./original_images ./test_images 100 100

## Data Augmentation
Training images can be augmented using the [Augmentor](https://github.com/mdbloice/Augmentor) library.

    python isic_dataset.py augment --help


Example: Augment images in *training_images*, generating 10000 augmented images

    python isic_dataset.py augment training_images 10000

The augmented images are stored in *training_images/output*

# img2dist
In order to evaluate how diverse the image set is generated by the GAN's we can use another tool **img2dist** that calculates a distance between two images based on [Color Quantization](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_color_quantization.html). A distance is defined as the sum of euclidean distances between the 5 closest centroids of an image in the RGB color space.

## Calculate the distance between two images
Calculate the distance of the two iamges Car.jpg and Airplane.jpg

```bash
python img2dist.py distance color_distance/OtherStuff/Car.jpg color_distance/OtherStuff/Airplane.jpg
```

## Generate a distance plot
In order to relate the distance of multiple images, one can create a plot that uses two dimensional embedding of the pairwise distances (in this case [multidimensional scaling](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.MDS.html))

Create a plot **training_images_subset.jpg** by calculating the distances for all pictures inside of **training_images_160x160_subset** 
```bash
python img2dist.py embedding --skip-labels training_images_subset.jpg training_images_160x160_subset/
```

Or compare the distance distribution of various image groups, by saving images in different sub-folders.

```bash
python img2dist.py embedding --group --group-labels --limits 2.0 color_distance_test.jpg color_distance/*
```

> Note: One can define the limits of the plot using  *--limits 2.0*
